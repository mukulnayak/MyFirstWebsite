    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Indian Institute of Technology Goa (IIT Goa) is an autonomous premier engineering and technology university
        located in Goa. Ever since an IIT was allotted to Goa by the Central government in 2014, the new Indian
        Institute of Technology (IIT) at Goa started functioning from July, 2016 in a temporary campus housed at Goa
        Engineering College (GEC) Campus located at Farmagudi, Goa. Currently, it offers BTech, MTech and PhD courses in
        various core and one non-core branches majorly in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering,
        Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics and Computing. It also offers MTech and PhD courses.

        As part of the mentorship plan, IIT-Bombay was the mentor for IIT-Goa for three pioneer years. The HRD Ministry
        had set up an IIT monitoring cell at IIT-Bombay and the committee members had been designated as officials on
        special duty to supervise the process of setting up IIT-Goa.

    <h2>Departments , Centres and Schools</h2>
    <p>
        In the first three years of IIT Goa, there were thirty seats each in the streams of computers , electrical and
        mechanical engineering were available at the institute and classes are slated to begin after 15 July 2016, along
        with the other IITs across the country. But now, IIT Goa is offering approximately 150 bachelor seats in
        Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and a new stream Mathematical
        and Computing has been introduced in year 2019. Apart from that, they also offer some seats for masters for same
        streams, and some for doctorate as well.

    <h2>Director's Message</h2>
    <p>
        In May 2016, the Union Cabinet gave its ex-post- facto approval to amend The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961,
        for corporation of six new IITs including IIT Goa — an institution of national importance. Subsequently on July
        30, 2016, IIT Goa made its auspicious beginning from the Goa Engineering College Campus at Farmagudi, Ponda.
        This was a day to remember. To commemorate this historic occasion, a plaque was unveiled by the then Hon’ble HRD
        Minister Mr. Prakash Javadekar in the presence of Hon’ble Defence Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar and the Hon’ble
        Chief Minister of Goa Mr. Laxmikant Parsekar. The first batch of 90 students were enrolled into three branches
        of Engineering — Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Science & Engineering. The entire teaching load was handled
        by faculties of IIT Bombay which continues to act as the mentoring Institute. As we progressed into the
        semester, we realized managing students in a makeshift campus and providing adequate facilities for faculties
        pose several challenges that required serious planning. One- by-one, all issues ranging from lecture rooms to
        housing were sorted out and we looked forward to the next semester.

        On March 9, 2017, I took charge as the Director of IIT Goa. We set our vision on four key themes: Teaching,
        Research, Outreach, and strategic planning for our future. Our immediate task is to build our campus. At present
        we are devoting most of our time to cast our distinctive strength by recruiting bright young faculties and
        initiating research programs in new and emerging areas of excellence. The task is cut out for us for the coming
        years, and only time will tell how well we put our ideas into practice.

        Goa has a rich cultural heritage—abundance of festival and assortment of attractions; there are so many places
        to explore! Therefore, since its inception IIT Goa has become a brand in itself, and I believe it will unleash
        its potential to accomplish great things in the future.
